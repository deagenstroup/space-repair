Each level is stored in a text file containing integers
corresponding to varius values needed for the levels 
construction. There are to be no spaces at the front of
each line or at the end and there is to be only one space
seprating each integer value.
The format goes like this:
[two integers for the window resolution]
[two integers for the starting position of the player]
[four integers for the rectangle of the repair modules]
...repeating until a semicolen is reached ";"
[three integers for powerup position and type]
 (x, y, type) (type 1 = light, type 2 = speed)
...repeating until a semicolen is reached ";"
[four integers for the rectangle of a wall]
...repeating this last format for however many walls are 
in the level.

-each four integer group is two coordinates (x, y)
representing the top-left vertice and the bottom-right
vertice of the rectangle, respectively
